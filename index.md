## This is Work In Progress!

Welcome to the zoo!

The purpose of this website is organizing the vast universe of anonymous
credentials.

## Zoo sections:

- [Implementations]({{site.baseurl}}/implementations.html): For anonymous credential schemes with concrete implementations
- [Research schemes]({{site.baseurl}}/schemes.html): For anonymous credential schemes with published papers
- [Properties]({{site.baseurl}}/properties.html): For the properties that various schemes have
- [Primitives]({{site.baseurl}}/primitives.html): For cryptographic primitives used to create anonymous credential schemes

## Research:

TODO: Would be nice to have something like anonibib or censobib but for anon credentials.

## Engineering:

- Trust Token API
- Format
