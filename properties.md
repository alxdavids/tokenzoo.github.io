## Unforgeability

Also studied [by Hoepman et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/842.pdf) for the case of multi-show credential schemes.

## Unlinkability

Defined here [by Camenisch et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/580.pdf) as a property of a signature scheme.

## Revocation

Defined here by [Acar et al.](https://www.iacr.org/archive/pkc2011/65710436/65710436.pdf) and
implemented using an accumulator scheme with delegatable non-membership proofs

Revocation can also be achieved with TODO

## Public Verifiability

An attribute-based credential (ABC) scheme allows a user, given a set of
attributes, toprove ownership of these attributes to a verifer and selectively
disclose some of them whilekeeping the others secret

## Delegatable

In a delegatable anonymous credential system, participants may use their
credentials anonymously as well as anonymously delegate them to other
participants.

Introduced in [CL06]({{site.baseurl}}/schemes.html#cl06).

## Escrow



## Threshold Issuance

A credential scheme where there can be multiple credential issuers which can
also potentially be Byzantine. (see [Coconut](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07344.pdf)).
